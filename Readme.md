## Abstract
This doctoral thesis explores the modeling of pathological tremors and develops suppression strategies using electrical stimulation, leveraging advanced control and optimization techniques. Starting with an overview of the affected population, it delves into biomechanical modeling of the wrist, employing OpenSim for direct dynamics simulations, and studying tremor genesis mechanisms. It advances into dynamical systems identification and control theory, applying genetic algorithms to tune Parkinson's tremor models. Further, it details the creation and validation of individualized tremor models, electrical stimulation hardware implementation, and clinical trial conduction, with a focus on ethical considerations and a timeline for the research's final stages, aiming to significantly contribute to pathological tremor mitigation.
